                "The List Festival is a small, boutique and cultural music and arts festival based at The Yorkshire Scare grounds in Wakefield. From July 29th to 31st 2022, it offers three carefully curated stages of music, a mouthwatering array of street food vendors and plenty of local artists doing live shows, drag queen performances and plenty more!\n\n\nWe are proudly small and independent with a warm and welcoming vibe. Catering towards music and art lovers of all ages with a boutique feel and bespoke look while showcasing diverse sounds in a laid back environment all within one safe area. The festival is proud to be all-inclusive: there is no discrimination to race, colour, creed or sexual orientation making it a real melting pot and a super safe environment where people are free to be themselves.\n\n\nThe festival has three main areas: Sin City that hosts Dottie a 1970’s airstream trailer fully kitted out with Master Sounds tech and a TPI sound system. Throughout the day it will provide everything from Balearic to House to Disco with UK favourites Crazy P, former Panorama Bar resident Prosumer, Manchester mainstay James Holroyd, plus more from Nancy Noise, Sally Rogers, Reeshy, Demi Riquisimo, J.Cub and PBR Streetgang. The icing on the cake comes in the form of Mark Farina flying in from Chicago to play his iconic mushroom jazz set!\n\n\nThe Forbidden Forest area is for after dark action in the woods with high end audio and striped back lighting that allows you to dance like nobody’s watching. The music reflects the surroundings; darker, deeper with an edge from the likes of Rob Mello, Lil Mark, Sean Johnston, Paramida, and Tristan da Cunha.\n\n\nThe Lucky Cat Cabaret area is new for 2022 and is colourful and flamboyant with an anything goes vibe. Heavy on production, celebrated radio personality JoJo will host drag acts, performances and anything her imagination can conjure during the day. As night falls, think of the spirit of ’The Paradise Garage’ with sets from Annabel Fraser, Jamie Bull, Red Laser Records, Apricot Ballroom and Buckley next to many more.\n\n\nTo keep you fuelled, there will be fresh pizza from Cozy P Pizza, boozy eats from Bastard’s Bistro and plant based world inspired cuisine from Honest Supper Club, with plenty of extra surprises also in store.\n\n\nThe List Festival is a cosy and compact gathering for cultured dancers of all ages. Do not miss.\n\nTICKETS - https://thelistfestival.co.uk",

                "Audio Farm is an annual grass roots music and arts festival.\n\nA celebration of the finest in electronic and live sounds, we curate a diverse lineup that brings together emerging underground talent, alongside huge headliner legends. Expect the best of House, Techno, Disco, Drum & Bass, Dub, Electro, Jungle, Reggae, Jazz, Rock, Ska, Balkan Folk, Acoustic and Afrobeat.\n\nOur home is nestled within the walled garden and lake of Hopton Court. A magical haven and perfect backdrop for Audio Farm Festival. Our talented build crew add layers of vibrant, psychedelic and organic design to the beautiful scenic site, and together create one of the best visual impacts you’ll find at a U.K. Festival.\n\nPart of the Audio Farm Festival experience is to balance out the high energy dance floors with some grounding and wholesome activities. The Lakeside Garden hosts a variety of healing & holistic classes, massage, talks, workshops, circus performance and fun games.\n\nA big part of Audio Farm Festival is the variety of ages that attend, with a huge emphasis being activities, workshops, talks and games for children for all ages, including the children’s open mic stage.\n\nFree from corporate sponsorship, our independent event is fighting the good fight to help keep Independent Music & Arts culture alive, and we do so whilst donating all our profits to Green Paw Project, a charity supporting animal welfare and environmental conservation.\n\nWe believe in looking after the planet and each other, and the sparkling atmosphere of the festival reflects that: everyone and anyone will always be welcome. Audio Farm Festival is proud to be fully vegan, sells no single use plastics, and our “leave no trace” policy runs through the festival viens. With the site being spotless of litter during the live days, and not a single item of rubbish left by the campers as they leave the festival.",
